# Snakes-and-Ladders
A Snakes and Ladders project developed in c++
Additional code libary 'console.cpp' that was responsable for clearing the screen after every loop has broken in the newest version. It has been removed from the project to allow it to build, but I have still included it in the files. I did not create this library.
